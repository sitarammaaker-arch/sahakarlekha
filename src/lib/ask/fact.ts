/**
 * The F-lane — Tier 0 (blueprint §4.2/§4.4). PURE. No model, ever.
 *
 * A rate is not a document to be retrieved and paraphrased — it is a KEY to be looked
 * up: exact, effective-dated, versioned, cited. Embedding search over a rate is how you
 * get a confidently-worded 2023 rate in 2026. So this lane never touches the corpus.
 *
 * Note the symmetry that gives the whole design away: the F-lane produces the only
 * answers stated as bare fact, and it is the lane with no intelligence in it at all.
 *
 * It answers ONLY from verified rules (rules/tax.ts). No verified rule ⇒ it returns
 * null and the caller hedges. That is not a gap to be closed by trying harder; it is
 * the guarantee. Each rule a human verifies converts one hedge into a fact — which is
 * the measurable payoff of Slice 2 and the reason it precedes the model.
